  title: Career Profile
  summary: |
    I love working with talented and driven people.
    I started developing at 12 and built my first tech company at 14.
    Even though I love to put on a hoodie, pop some red bulls and program through the night,
    I constantly find myself drawn to managing product teams, market strategies and sometimes, sales.

    Because of the startup (HeyCheff) I founded with some other incredible people,
    I had the opportunity to learn a bit of every main area in a company, from product to sales.
    Besides, it also allowed me to learn from some of the most amazing professionals that worked with us as mentors and investors.

    After selling HeyCheff to Máxima, I was able work in a corporate environment and face the challenge to manage a team of 20+ people,
    which I hadn't hired and take to market a product that I hadn't developed. This was one of the most intense and hard moments of my career until now, but I love all the knowledge and experience it brought to my life.
